# HIV Viral Load Predictive Model with BentoML

**Description:**

Welcome to the HIV Viral Load Predictive Model project, powered by BentoML. This repository showcases our cutting-edge machine-learning solution that utilizes BentoML for streamlined model deployment and management.

## Project Overview:

HIV viral load is a crucial parameter for monitoring and managing HIV/AIDS patients. Our project revolves around developing and deploying a predictive model that accurately estimates HIV viral load based on patient data. What sets us apart is our use of BentoML, a versatile framework for MLOps that simplifies the deployment of machine learning models.

**BentoML Integration:** Our repository demonstrates how to integrate BentoML into the machine learning pipeline. BentoML allows us to package the model, dependencies, and API endpoints into a single container, streamlining deployment and management.
